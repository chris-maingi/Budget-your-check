## 📘 About the Project

This project was inspired by two popular personal finance books:

- _The Richest Man in Babylon_ — recommends a **70/20/10** allocation.
- _I Will Teach You To Be Rich_ — recommends a **50/30/20** allocation.

After researching different modern budgeting approaches, this app uses a **balanced 50/30/10/10** system:
- **50%** → Bills (necessities)
- **30%** → Fun (lifestyle)
- **10%** → Savings
- **10%** → Investments

The program takes your paycheck amount and instantly calculates how much should go into each category.
